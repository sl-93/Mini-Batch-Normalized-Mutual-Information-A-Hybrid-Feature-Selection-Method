# Mini-Batch-Normalized-Mutual-Information-A-Hybrid-Feature-Selection-Method
implementation feature selection with novel proposed method by python.

this method has two phases:

1.Feature Ranking: feature ranking function based on the filter approach.

2.Feature selection: the selection of optimal features based upon the ranking.

I've used "Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits" Dataset for this project.
